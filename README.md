# Time Series Analysis and Weather Forecast Project

## Project Description
This project is an experimental Data Science side project using Python to conduct Time Series Analysis and Weather Forecasts.

## Data Source
The data have been downloaded from the website http://rp5.ru/. The data are average daily temperatures collected by the weather station 2978 in Helsinki from January 2015 to September 2019.

## Tasks

This project sets and addresses the following questions: 
* How to conduct a Time-Series Analysis project from raw data?
* How to deal with a Time-Series data that has seasonality?
* Implementing the Moving Average to capture long-term fluctuations
* Parameter Selection for the model using GRID Search
* Make Weather Forecasts using the SARIMAX model
* How to diagnose the model performance using charts and other metrics (AIC score, RMSE value)?
